[Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) is a multiroom client-server audio player developed by [badaix](https://github.com/badaix), where all clients are time synchronized with the server to play perfectly synced audio. It's not a standalone player, but an extension that turns your existing audio player into a Sonos-like multiroom solution.
